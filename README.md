Overview of analysis

The reason of this analysis is to get more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, we want temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round Once we run our queries, we store the temperatures in a list then convert them to a dataframe. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics by using the .describe() method. Here is what we found:

In June total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0
 

In December a total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0
 
Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 -- making a .5 difference in the two different seasons

Summary:


Our analysis only provides temperatures data for month of June and December, however there are other elements to the weather such as precipitation it shows that we can run extra queries to have better understanding whether or not people can come and visit the shop.
